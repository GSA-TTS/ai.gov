# 6. Design system

Date: 2025-05-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The AI Platform project requires a description of Console architecture decisions. 

## Decision

The Console team create a separate astro app (`console`) within the ai.gov monorepo similar to `site` and utilize shared components between the apps.

## Alternatives Considered

In parallel with the assessment of a separate `console` app, integration and extension into the current `site` app was also assessed.

To do this, engineering built a separate `console` app along with extending the `site` app with console routes and then came together to discuss the pros and cons of each.


## Consequences

A separate `console` app within the monorepo has several benefits:

- Clear separation of concerns

Each app has a distinct purpose and code base.

- Independent deployment

Risk reduction when making updates.

- Performance benefits

Smaller bundles for each app.

- Team scalability

Different teams can work on different apps with clearer ownership boundries.

- Technology divergence 

Can optimize each app for its specific use case

While there are many benefits, there are certain downsides that were considered like development overhead with duplicate configuration and boilerplate, and authentication complexity.
