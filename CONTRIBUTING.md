# Contributing

## Respect and Appreciation
Be excellent to one another. We respect and appreciate our teammates as individual people and as co-workers. We take time to give regular feedback and accept that our differences can also be a strength.

## Assume Positive Intent
We encourage trust and default to assuming our teammates are working to the best of their ability with the resources and information they have now. We approach each situation on its own terms and respond accordingly. 

## Bias toward action
We value a bias toward action, radiating intent and open collaboration. We value individuals and interactions over processes and tools. This means taking action when you are able, while making your actions visible and giving teammates the opportunity to be full collaborators when they choose. We value open invitations to collaborate over waiting for explicit permission before making non-destructive changes. We prioritize quickly responding to change over following a plan. We prioritize working software that is accessible to other teammates over comprehensive documentation. 

## Communication 
We value open and honest communication and go out of our way to understand one another to provide context and clarity. We believe cooperation and communication are keys to our success. Use Slack and ad hoc 1:1s liberally as needed, but invite appropriately and document outcomes consistently. 

## Feedback
Feedback is a function of respect when you are the giver or the receiver. We use a formal peer feedback process when verbal communication strategies have failed. 

## Knowledge sharing
We share as much knowledge as possible with one another to allow us to continuously build, grow and improve our product. This includes adding appropriate notes, comments, and details in GitHub items. 

## Experimentation 
Because we don’t know what we don’t know. By experimenting, we increase optionality which helps us learn/reveal what we don’t know through the process of elimination. Sometimes multiple experiments are needed and failures can inform successes. Sometimes experiments will fail no matter what and that is okay too. All experiments should be time boxed and have a concrete set of goals.

## Quality
Find ways to cross-check and validate reporting and analysis. We embrace exceptions and refactoring code. Mistakes are valued as learning opportunities and failure generates more knowledge. We retrospect on failures and success to make improvements for the future. We work on stories in collaboration with one another because it produces higher quality software, shortens feedback loops, increases creativity, and strengthens knowledge sharing.

## Pull Requests
Try to keep PRs small and limited in scope. Don't try to add unrelated minor edits to the pull request as it makes it harder to review. Instead, stash your work, branch off of `main` for the unrelated minor edit, and file a PR for the minor edit. You can then rebase that change into your working branch for your main line of work.

## Development process

### Reviewing and approving code. 

- Communicate about PRs. Ask questions. Give feedback. 
- Make sure PRs are visible: Notify team members in Slack that a PR is ready for review and add the link.
- Use the pairing with other engineers to review PRs, even if there are no questions, so that everyone is aware of code changes.
- At least one review is required to merge a PR.
- PRs should not be merged with "unresolved" comments. A response or acknowledgement reaction should be entered for each comment/question, before clicking "Resolve Comment" 
- New PRs get a Slack thread in the team channel for visibility and communication
- When a story is ready for acceptance, ping reviewer

### Collaboration

We default to collaborative working styles. We do this because it produces higher quality software, helps developers find defects in a shorter feedback loop, increases creativity, and strengthens knowledge sharing. We encourage communication that occurs during scheduled meeting times and on an ad-hoc basis. Do not wait for a standing meeting to discuss issues that may arise.   

- We practice human-centered design to inform technical and design decisions. UX are embedded members of the team and perform usability tests, interviews, brainstorming sessions and collaborate with devs and the PO throughout the SDLC.
- Listen and be attentive. Make sure you are leaving space in a conversation for others to chime in. 
- We favor emergent architecture over "big up-front design." Consistent with agile, we optimize for serving the emergent needs of users, instead of planning and executing an architecture that cannot respond to those changing needs. 
- Refactoring is a regular and expected part of story work.
- We follow agreed upon guidelines and processes for code review, code merge, refactoring, definitions of ready/done, and test coverage. 
- We identify, prioritize, and fix technical risk within the system.
- Embrace and drive change. We recognize that this work requires constant learning on the part of all participants, and embrace the state of not-knowing that must precede learning.
